<h1> Welcome to Budget Vocality </h1>

<h2> A simple voice activated budgeting app, that will help you save a bit of money, while making sure you don't go broke!</h2>

<p> We built our application using the Android SDK, Google Voice, and the API-AI Natural Language Processing Framework, for our
voice recognition, and speech AI </p>

<h3> What the future holds </h3>
<p> We believe this application has great potential, and would love to have others work on it alongside us, an easy to use budgeting application is what everyone needs, in this day and time. We plan on making the application, have access to a database of all your past purchases, and then utilizing an algorithim determine spending patters and habits, to then streamline the Artificial Intelligence, along with Machine Learning to help you save even more, in the simplest way possible! </p>

<h4> We hope you like the project, we made in just over 24 hours at Hack Western 3, and hope to see it go even further </h4>
